# Ideas
**Theme: The more you have, the worse it is**
* Physically simulated starships: Heat is bad, so follows the theme, ya?
* Text adventure game about disposing of toxic waste
* Top-down driving game about disposing of toxic waste
* Roguelike where having more money causes you to get robbed
  * Maybe you pick up the pieces of some ancient amulet (of Yendor?), but each one you get makes the game harder.
  * This is like the opposite of good roguelike design! What about a mordor-like?
  *
* Some kind of physics based cargo hauling game. Maybe where you fly a VTOL/zeppelin and the more cargo you carry the less maneuverable you are.
  * You fly a VTOL thing. The more cargo you pick up, the more ungainly you get.
  * Some packages expire, so you might need to take those to their destinations first
  * Yeah, there's a cable component
  * Doesn't encouraging people to take fewer packages make it boring?
  * Hazards: Enemy drones, flak cannons, and tall buildings
